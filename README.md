# Desktop Video Compress

Automatic Desktop Video Compression for macOS - A lightweight background service that watches your Desktop for `.mov` files and automatically compresses them using HandBrake CLI.

Perfect for screen recordings, video clips, and other videos that need to be optimized for web upload.

## Features

- üé¨ Automatically watches `~/Desktop` for new `.mov` files
- üóúÔ∏è Compresses videos using HandBrake CLI with web-optimized settings
- üîî Sends macOS notifications when compression starts and finishes
- ‚úÖ Checks for HandBrake CLI availability on startup
- üöÄ Runs automatically on login via LaunchAgent
- üìä Shows compression statistics (original size, compressed size, savings %)
- üìù Maintains logs in `~/Library/Logs/`

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3** - Usually pre-installed on macOS, or install via:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   ```

2. **HandBrake CLI** - Required for video compression:
   ```bash
   brew install handbrake
   ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matthewpick/desktop-video-compress.git
   cd desktop-video-compress
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

The installation script will:
- Install Python dependencies (watchdog)
- Create a LaunchAgent to run the service automatically
- Start the service immediately
- Configure it to start on login

You'll receive a notification when the service starts watching your Desktop.

## Usage

Once installed, the service runs automatically in the background. Simply:

1. Save or move a `.mov` file to your Desktop
2. The service will detect it and start compression
3. You'll receive a notification when compression starts
4. When complete, you'll get a notification with compression statistics
5. The compressed file will be saved as `[original_name]_compressed.mov`

### Example

If you save `screen_recording.mov` to your Desktop:
- Original file: `screen_recording.mov` (100 MB)
- Compressed file: `screen_recording_compressed.mov` (25 MB)
- You'll get a notification: "Original: 100.0MB ‚Üí Compressed: 25.0MB (75.0% savings)"

## Configuration

The service uses HandBrake's "Fast 1080p30" preset with the following settings:
- H.264 encoder (x264)
- Quality: 22 (good balance between size and quality)
- Web optimized for faster streaming

To modify compression settings, edit `desktop_video_compress.py` and adjust the HandBrake command parameters.

## Logs

Logs are stored in:
- `~/Library/Logs/desktop-video-compress.log` - Main application log
- `~/Library/Logs/desktop-video-compress-stdout.log` - Standard output
- `~/Library/Logs/desktop-video-compress-stderr.log` - Standard error

## Uninstallation

To stop and remove the service:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will:
- Stop the service
- Remove the LaunchAgent
- Keep the script files (in case you want to reinstall)

## Manual Control

### Start the service manually (for testing):
```bash
python3 desktop_video_compress.py
```

### Stop the service:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.desktop.video.compress.plist
```

### Restart the service:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.desktop.video.compress.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.desktop.video.compress.plist
```

## Troubleshooting

### HandBrake not found
If you get an error that HandBrake is not installed:
```bash
brew install handbrake
```

The service automatically searches for HandBrake in common locations:
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/handbrakecli` (Apple Silicon Mac)
- `/usr/local/bin/handbrakecli` (Intel Mac)
- `/usr/bin/handbrakecli` (Linux)

It checks for both `HandBrakeCLI` and `handbrakecli` executable names.

### Service not starting
Check the logs in `~/Library/Logs/` for error messages.

### No notifications
Make sure Python has permission to send notifications in System Preferences ‚Üí Notifications.

**Note:** When running as a LaunchAgent, the script uses `osascript` for notifications. If you're not seeing notifications, check that:
1. The service has permission to send notifications (System Preferences ‚Üí Notifications)
2. The logs show "Notification sent" messages (check `~/Library/Logs/desktop-video-compress.log`)

### Files not being processed
- Check that the file is a `.mov` file
- Check that the filename doesn't already contain `_compressed`
- Check the logs for errors
